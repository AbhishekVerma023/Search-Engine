# Search-Engine
Implementation of KMP algorithm for creating a search engine

## Introduction
A search query is taken as input & then processed in the following order:-

1)Tokenized using nltk word tokenize<br />
2)Removed the articles, pronouns & prepositions using stopwords<br />
3)Removed the affixes using stemmer<br />

Now, we have the filtered string which'll be searched in the sample database.<br />
Sample database consists of a .txt file which has certain links to be parsed & searched for.<br />

The links are opened & searched via KMP Algorithm for pattern matching.<br /><br />

Normalizing the search results -> done using normalization score<br />
Normalization score -> (occurences of words in input string)/(total number of words)<br /><br />

By this normalization score, we calculate the relevance of the links. Now, we display them in decreasing order of their relevance. <br />
<br /> <br />

Before running, make sure you have the required libraries installed.
